Analysis of students’ social media usage, sleep patterns, and addiction indicators using Excel
# Student Social Media Usage and Addiction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes survey data on students’ social media usage habits and addiction-related behaviors. The goal is to understand usage patterns, identify potential risks, and prepare the data for deeper exploratory and behavioral analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset contains survey responses from students, including demographic information, social media usage behavior, sleep patterns, mental health indicators, and addiction-related scores. Each row represents an individual student.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed in Excel. Key steps included handling missing values, removing duplicate records, standardizing categorical variables, validating numeric ranges, and creating derived fields such as usage category and addiction level.

## Data Validation & Quality Checks
Data validation was performed using pivot tables to confirm logical relationships between social media usage, sleep duration, academic level, and addiction categories. Any inconsistencies identified were traced back to data types or categorization logic and corrected to ensure analytical reliability.

## Output
The cleaned and validated dataset was exported for use in further exploratory analysis, SQL querying, and dashboard development.
